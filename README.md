# NeuralNetworkTorchPython
Neural network with 2 inputs, four neurons in hidden layer, one output, using PyTorch and a two bit binary input stream.
You don't need a GPU - any PC should run it, runs on my Android too. I used Python version 3.11.
Its simple but got the essentials and works. Sometimes you need to run it twice to get reasonable results.
You can adjust the inputs, hidden layers, outputs, epochs a
